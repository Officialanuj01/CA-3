I hope you find all the working links here.
I have completed my CA3 of front-end web development, and I have created a food website here that suggests random daily meals.
I have used API  for fetching data for the random dish.
I have taken Google help to get an idea about the design. during this time I have visited many websites.
Thanks to all those websites.
